GUI
Fix side scrolling in Tables

GAUSSIAN INPUT READER
Look through UNUSED tags

SETTINGS
Settings related to elements should be in Data
Make a UI for Settings

NOTIFICATIONS
Add more verbose information
Allow scrolling of recent notifications
updateTaskBar should be a function

COLOURS
All colours should be unified in ColorScheme.ColorScheme

CHECKERS
Prevent checkers from "fixing" errors that aren't caught - or add them to checkers

CHAINS/GetChain
Make sure that not checking this won't break the program - split geometry for external command by chain first.

CLEANER
Some functions should be moved to other classes such as AMBER and parameter calculations.
Will need to update Tasks.xml and tasks.html
Make GetResidueGroup non-recursive. DONE but needs checking.

PROTONATOR
Provide some progress feedback for R.E.D.

ARROWS/TASKS/PROCEDURES
Simplify this by moving info to Flow.xml and Tasks.xml
Remove switches from ArrowFunctions and give this responsibility to the xml files so the user can modify
See if ArrowProcedure is even necessary - a lot of repetition
Probably can't touch TIDs as they reference functions

MATHEMATICS
Make functions to change Angle and Dihedral

ATOMS
Reevaluate the ChangePDBID() method. Looks like it only reconnects internal connections.
Fix ResetConnectivity()

ATOM VISUALISER
Changed MoveCamera IEnumerator

Consider moving Arrow Procedure static classes to instance 
-> can increment activeTasks in Constructors and decrement in destructors
